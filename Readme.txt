Diabetes Prediction using AI

Brief:
- The purpose of this project is to create an AI model in Python that can accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes based on a set of health indicators.
- By implementing thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation, this project seeks to enhance predictive accuracy and provide valuable insights into the factors influencing diabetes

Project Structure
- env folder: Contains the Python virtual environment with all necessary libraries installed to isolate dependencies.
- diabetes.csv: The dataset used for training the model, containing data related to diabetes symptoms and diagnoses.
- diabetes.py: The main Python script that processes the dataset and trains the machine learning model.
- Readme.txt: This file, containing detailed information about the project setup, usage, and structure.

Libraries Used
- sklearn: A powerful Python library for implementing machine learning, data mining, and data analysis algorithms efficiently.
- pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools for Python.
- matplotlib: A plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy, used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
